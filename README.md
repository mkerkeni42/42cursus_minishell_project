# Minishell: Shell Shocked but Not Broken! 💥🐚

## Overview
**Minishell** is a personal shell project from the 42 curriculum that introduces command-line interfaces, process management, and signal handling. Key features include:
- **Interactive CLI**: Seamless user input for executing commands.
- **Process Management**: Efficient use of `fork`, `execve`, and `waitpid`.
- **Signal Handling**: Graceful response to user interruptions (like `ctrl-C`).
- **Redirection & Piping**: Supports input/output redirection and command piping.
- **Built-in Commands**: Includes essential commands like `echo`, `cd`, `pwd`, `export`, `unset`, `env`, and `exit`.

Collaborating with **Yani K.**, we tackled the complexities of shell implementation and emerged stronger.

## How to Use ⚙️

Just compile the program with `make` and run it with:
```
./minishell
```
And then, you can use it as a real shell !

## Challenges Faced 💪
One of the biggest hurdles in this project was parsing the command line. Designing the **lexer**, **parser**, and **expander** required a deep understanding of syntax and structure
.  

There were moments of confusion as we navigated through various edge cases and attempted to handle user inputs robustly.❓💻  

However, the challenge also became a bonding experience with Yani K., as we supported each other through late-night debugging sessions.🌙🔧  
Together, we transformed this complex task into a valuable learning opportunity, solidifying our friendship and technical skills. 🤝📚

## What I Learned 🌱
I gained skills in teamwork, problem-solving, and resilience. Key takeaways include:
- Understanding concurrency and **process management**.
- Importance of proper **signal management**.
- Value of **collaboration** in overcoming challenges.

**Fun Facts** 🤓: This project is known for testing friendships! While many say it can break bonds, my partnership with Yani K. only strengthened ours. Completing this project marks a significant milestone in the 42 curriculum!

Minishell is not just a shell, it's a journey through the intricacies of process management and a testament to the power of collaboration. I'm excited to carry these lessons into my future projects! 🚀
